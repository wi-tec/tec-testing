## Getting started

### Prepare the local site:

Prepare for local development:

* Visit http://editorconfig.org/ for instructions on how to configure your IDE or editor to use the included `.editorconfig` file.
* Copy example.config.yml to default.config.yml
* Edit default.config.yml and update the following:
    * vagrant_synced_folders - local_path: `your-path` (modify as necessary)
* [Mac/Linux only] Install Ansible Galaxy roles required for this VM: `sudo ansible-galaxy install -r provisioning/requirements.yml --force`

* `vagrant up`

Install Dependencies:
* `composer install`
* `npm install`

Prepare the site:

* `./scripts/local_settings.sh`
* `./scripts/tec-testing_local_install.sh`

## Behat Testing

Uses the [Drupal Extension](http://behat-drupal-extension.readthedocs.org/en/3.1/index.html) to Behat and Mink.

```bash
./scripts/local_behat.sh
```
### Wraith (Visual Regression)
In this generator we include Wraith for visual regression testing, to use it go to `wraith/configs/capture.yaml` and change the domains urls, the paths you want to test and the breakpoints if needed, then go back to the root path of your project and run:

```
./scripts/tec-testing_wraith_testing.sh
```
Once finished the execution of the script go to:

```
wraith/shots
```
And that's it, now you can make sure everything looks as expected just by opening the generated gallery in your browser.
